    <h2>Time Management Matrix</h2>
    <p>This exercise made me realize how much time I had unknowingly been spending on distractions that didn’t serve my goals. The matrix helped me visualize my priorities better. Since then, I've been more conscious about investing time in personal growth activities rather than reacting to urgency. It’s made a real difference in my daily productivity and sense of control.</p>

    <h2>Goal Setting</h2>
    <p>Goal setting no longer feels like a task for me; it feels like planning my success. Through this session, I learned how essential it is to set goals that truly resonate with me. I started breaking larger goals into smaller steps, and that made them more manageable. Every small win now feels like a powerful motivator.</p>

    <h2>Circle of Control</h2>
    <p>Understanding the Circle of Control changed the way I deal with stress. I now try to differentiate between what I can control and what I must let go of. This shift has made me more relaxed and centered. I focus my attention on my reactions and responsibilities instead of worrying about things I cannot influence.</p>

    <h2>Extempore Speaking</h2>
    <p>Initially, extempore speaking made me nervous, but gradually I began to enjoy it. I learned how to organize my thoughts quickly and express them clearly. It boosted my confidence, not just in speaking but also in thinking on my feet. Now, I look forward to these moments as opportunities to grow.</p>

    <h2>Overcoming Meditation Obstacles</h2>
    <p>My meditation journey taught me the value of patience and persistence. I learned that thoughts are natural, and it's okay to have them. With time, I became more aware of my emotions and reactions. It’s made me calmer and more connected with myself. Meditation is now a cherished part of my daily routine.</p>

    <h2>Strategies for Inner Peace</h2>
    <p>Inner peace isn’t a destination, it’s a practice. I discovered the power of routines like journaling and gratitude reflection. Whenever life feels overwhelming, I take a pause, reconnect with myself, and ground my thoughts. These strategies have helped me stay calm, resilient, and more emotionally aware.</p>

    <h2>Group Discussion</h2>
    <p>Participating in group discussions helped me enhance my communication and active listening skills. I learned how to articulate my ideas clearly while respecting different perspectives. It was a great opportunity to collaborate, think critically, and grow as a team player. Over time, I became more confident in sharing my thoughts constructively.</p>

    <h2>Movie Takeaways - Big Hero 6</h2>
    <p>Big Hero 6 was more than just a movie—it felt like a story I could see myself in. The emotional resilience of Hiro, the selflessness of Tadashi, and the warmth of Baymax reminded me how love, loss, and friendship shape who we become. It inspired me to turn pain into purpose and use creativity to solve problems with compassion.</p>
